# WebsitePortfolio

Welcome to my personal website portfolio! 🤯✨😍

I created this portfolio to showcase my projects and broaden my skills in frontend web development. This project has been an exciting journey where I’ve delved into the world of Vue.js and SCSS. By building this portfolio, I aimed not only to present my work but also to learn Vue.js.

Explore my projects, learn something about me, and see how I’ve applied my new knowledge of Vue.js to create this portfolio.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the experience!
